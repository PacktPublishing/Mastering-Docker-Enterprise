**A companion guide for agile container adoption**

## What is this book about?
While known mostly as the open source engine behind tens of millions of server nodes, Docker also offers commercially supported enterprise tooling known as the Docker Enterprise. This platform leverages the deep roots from Docker Engine - Community (formerly Docker CE) and Kubernetes, but adds support and tooling to efficiently operate a secure container platform at scale. With hundreds of enterprises on board, best practices and adoption patterns are emerging rapidly. These learning points can be used to inform adopters and help manage the enterprise transformation associated with enterprise container adoption.

This book covers the following exciting features:
Understand why containers are important to an enterprise 
Understand the features and components of Docker Enterprise 2 
Find out about the PoC, pilot, and production adoption phases 
Get to know the best practices for installing and operating Docker Enterprise 
Understand what is important for a Docker Enterprise in production 
Run Kubernetes on Docker Enterprise
